## Project Description
The project consists in the design and the implementation of a website for a tourist office of a cultural tourism destination. The requirements contain some constraints about the content and relationships of the main entities of the website.
The project is divided into three main parts: Design, Backend, Frontend.

### Design
Descrivere cosa abbiamo messo nel design document: C-idm wireframes ecc  
The design document is available [here](insert link here).

### Backend Technologies
+ NPM is the Node Package Manager used in this project to download and manage the rquired modules.
+ NodeJS is used in the implementation to create a fully working Web Server by using the Express module.
+ Express is a module providing a flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
+ PostgreSQL is an open source db used to store the data required to populate the HTML pages
+ Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js Object–relational mapping tool used to make querying the database during API calls easier 

### Frontend Technologies
+ Axios is promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and is used to handle all the requests to the server's API
+ HTML/CSS are used to structure and style the different pages in the website 

### Frameworks 
+ Vue.js
+ Nuxt.js

### Final Comments and Decisions

- errori da url errati non necessarrio 
- components
- layout
- altro se c'è
